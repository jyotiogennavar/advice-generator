## My process

- I first focussed on building the UI of the page. 
- After the UI was done, then I proceeded to render the API into the code.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The aim of this project was to learn to import data from an third party API and display it to users. I learnt to use useState and useEffect to render the data.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau - Center a Div](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) - This helped me to center the card. This is a great resource with many different examples
